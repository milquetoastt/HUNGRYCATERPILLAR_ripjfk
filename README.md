This is code for our project, a cardboard recreation of the assassination of president John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

A quick explanation:
The entire rest of the code is dependent on our Lee Harvey Oswald switch being in place. If that switch isn't reading as active, then nothing else can happen.

If the car is on checkpoint one, there are zero shots fired, and the gun is being fired, then the bullet servo will move 70 degrees. This represents a bullet leaving LHO's gun and missing JFK.

Next, the user moves JFK's car to the second checkpoint. If the car is on that checkpoint, only one shot has been fired, and the gun trigger is being pulled, then the bullet servo will again move. This represents the second bullet hitting JFK in the neck and back.

Next, if the car is on checkpoint 2, 2 shots have been fired, and the gun trigger is being pulled, then the bullet servo will move again, for the final time. After this, the servo attached to JFK's head will move, decapitating him.

The user then moves the car to the final checkpoint, and the Dallas Police Department servo moves 180 degrees.
